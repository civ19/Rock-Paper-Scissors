# Rock-Paper-Scissors

## Simple Rock Paper Scissors game, CLI Based.

This project is a fun rock paper scissors game ran with CLI, and is essentially where you can play against the AI for as many rounds as you want. Features of this game include:
- Choosing how many rounds you want to play for per session (just one session is boring), so you have the freedom to choose whether you want something quick and fun, or long and intense.
- Score tally after the game ends. After you've finished your rounds and the game is over, the system tallies up the points, and the one who gets the most points wins. It'll also tell you who won, so don't worry.

## Instructions on how to run 

- There are a few things to keep in mind when running this. Right after you run the executable, you will be greeted with a welcome message, telling you to press X to start. In order for the game to progress, you need to make sure you enter the right key (not `R`, but `X`). Whether the X is capital or common, it'll run regardless.
- After that, you will be asked how many rounds of rock paper scissors you want to do with the bot. Please dont input a letter for this field, as it will crash. Any number is fine.
- The game will run as normal, and you will be instructed on how to play and how to let the program know your move (whether it's rock, paper or scissors).

## Can you add more?

Yes! Feel free to enhance this project for your personal use since it's open source. Modifying it is straightforward! Just download the source .cpp file and compile it using your preferred IDE. Thatt's all you need for the files. If youâ€™re using Visual Studio Code, make sure to install the C/C++ extension, set up MinGW, and add it to your Windows environment variables. Once everything is configured, you can freely edit and customize the code to your liking. If you are using a different code editor, there are ways to set it up there, too. Or you could run it in a web-based IDE if you dont want the hassle.
